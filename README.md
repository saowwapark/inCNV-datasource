# inCNV-datasource

The major concern for choosing an application is to software sustainability. inCNV deal with this problem by creating this project, _inCNV-datasource_.\

This project provides updated data sources for [inCNV web-based application](https://github.com/saowwapark/inCNV). The data include some part of public databases: UCSC26, Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), ClinVar, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Ensembl and HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee at the European Bioinformatics Institute (HGNC). inCNV uses them for genetic annotations to analyze CNV on whole exome sequencing.\

## How to use

For more details about how to use those annotations, please see at [inCNV implementation](https://github.com/saowwapark/inCNV#Impementation) and [inCNV installation](https://github.com/saowwapark/inCNV#Installation)\

## Data accuracy

Users can see the content of data, what version of data public databases provide, and what version of data we reformat on [released page](https://github.com/saowwapark/inCNV-datasource/releases).
